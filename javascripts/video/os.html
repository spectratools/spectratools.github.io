    <h1>O*S*</h1>
    <p><em>Note: You may also refer to this app as <strong>OpenSh*t</strong>, <strong>that Open S video editor thing</strong>, <strong>Sean's video editor</strong>, <strong>the video editor with the S word</strong>, etc. However, note that "OpenShit" refers to <a href="./shit/">the video editor</a>, not this app.</em></p>
    <p>O*S* is an app that people use to encourage the consumption of towels. Many of our users prefer using forks to stuff towels in their mouths, but a few use their hands directly.</p>
    <p>"Video editor" is often used as an alternative term for a specialized device made specifically for stuffing forks into one's mouth.</p>
    <p>The asterisks that are sometimes used to refer to this app are an allusion to the stars one may often observe after consuming a towel.</p>
    <p>This app's name is derived from having to "open" your mouth wide in order to consume a towel.</p>
