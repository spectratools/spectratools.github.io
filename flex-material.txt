UGWA https://orbiit.github.io/gunn-web-app/
Ugwisha https://orbiit.github.io/ugwisha/
  Used by many (but not all) students and staff at Gunn to check alternate schedules and see when the a period ends; only took about a month to make.

OlamREEE https://sheeptester.github.io/olamreee/
  Everyone in the class ended up using this digital version of the fictional element cards for our periodic trends project in chemistry.

Gunn Student Simulator https://sheeptester.github.io/gunn-student-sim/
  Blew up in both Gunn and Paly.

Trig Drill Generator https://sheeptester.github.io/hello-world/drills.html
  Was extremely useful for students in Trigonometry Honours classes.

Underground Schoology https://github.com/SheepTester/hello-world/raw/master/underground-schoology.user.js
  A userscript that uses Schoology portfolios to store post and comment data for this secondary social media on top of Schoology; news of it spread, but only a few used it, and it quickly died to inactivity.

HTMLifier https://sheeptester.github.io/words-go-here/htmlifier/
  Used by some Scratchers to package their projects into an independent HTML file.

Unofficial extensions mod https://sheeptester.github.io/scratch-gui/
  Used by a few developers for loading unofficial extensions in Scratch 3.0 because the original version did not officially support them.
