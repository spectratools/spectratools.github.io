What are your favourite piece(s)?

> My favorite piece was definitely your expert project! Although it was short, it was really engaging and I loved how you combined the writing with one of your other interests. If you are planning to continue, I would love to play any other levels you might develop. Even though it was short, I liked that you provided instructions for the user and didn't just immediately jump into the action. I think this idea has a lot of potential and you could possibly create a whole game! Overall, this was my favorite piece and I really enjoyed the fact that it was interactive.

> My absolute favorite writing piece was 'Saluting the People's Flag of Northeast Narnia'. It was clever and while the ending was a little confusing, I found the story layout amusing and entertaining to read. Putting that aside, I think your Expert Project is the highlight of your portfolio. The fact that you were able to combine writing to an interactive game was sick! It was short, but simple and fun!

> Cool portfolio! Your writing was really descriptive in all of your pieces, which I thought helped develop your plot and characters well. I especially liked your short story because it was suspenseful and the plot unfolded like the scenes of a movie do—by the way, visualizing a floating figure that's chasing you is very terrifying. So, good job.

> I liked all of your pieces, but "Saluting the People's Flag of Northeast Narnia" stood out to me because you delved into this alternative universe and paid close attention to details. You clearly put in a lot of effort in this piece, and I liked how you also experimented with different writing styles, like press releases, court records and letters. And your character names were pretty rad. I can't decide which name I like more—Leuf Munkler or Istinipheous Phage.

> Your portfolio was so unique and fascinating! I also really liked that you added the introduction at the beginning--a unique and personal touch. My favorite piece was definitely "I think so, that is, we have Ms. Vernesty on Wednesday". I loved how you were so detailed with everything (from Ms. Vernesty's hot pink outfit to her interactions with Kai and the rest of the class), and I think those details made Ms. Vernesty seem so real (and also familiar haha)! Overall, it was very funny and entertaining to read.

> My favorite piece was Saluting the People's Flag of Northeast Narnia. The way you wrote the piece was so creative and unique. I liked that it was not the structure of a regular fictional piece and it felt like a collection of artifacts from Narnia and I loved it. The amount of detail in the pieces was also really cool. For example, at the end of a newspaper clip you wrote " Lorienne Vutanie is a writer and journalist for The Independent Times." and I thought that was such a small but awesome detail to include. 

> My favorite piece was your expert project. It was new and very different from anything else I've seen. It definitely creative. I also like the dialog between the guard and 38.
