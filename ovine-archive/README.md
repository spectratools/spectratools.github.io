## Notes

Maybe the idea behind this is that some sheep found these stories strewn somewhere and decided to collect them and label them some weird name, as seen at the bottom of the document because it ruins my syntax highlighting.

Getting the Unicode character for an italicized *p* can be done from https://yaytext.com/bold-italic/.

One could say that the documents were found deep in the archives in Ovine Loc 87. The name seemed to have been caused by the sheep's deficiency in computer literacy, but due to the strict guidelines on titles of ovine works, regardless of the original author, the exact style&mdash;except for the font family itself&mdash;must be preserved.
