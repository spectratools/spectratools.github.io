      <h1>1<sup>st</sup> Amendment / Freedom of Assembly</h1>
      <p>There's also stuff about the <a href="http://lesha.website/s/history/">Freedom of the Press</a>.</p>
      <h2 id='mean'>What the freedom of assembly means</h2>
      <img title="These people wouldn't be here talking to each other without the freedom of assembly." src="https://assets.entrepreneur.com/content/16x9/822/20151002170856-controllers-business-people-working-papers-meeting.jpeg" alt="A meeting.">

      <p>The Freedom of Assembly defends the right to peacefully meet with anyone. It also allows people to use crowds to spread messages. The freedom lets anyone meet and talk about any topic without worrying about getting in trouble.</p>
      <p>However, it doesn't allow people to assemble if the meeting will hurt other people, cause chaos, or take advantage of violence. Permits are required to protest so protesters and people being protested against can stay safe and civilians have enough space.</p>
      <img title="These protesters are allowed to protest given that they don't cause chaos." src="http://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2017_04/1883531/170129-muslim-ban-protest-white-house-ok-1349_410fbd40854763eec9cf84156f39ee6f.nbcnews-ux-2880-1000.jpg" alt="A protest.">

      <h2 id='hist'>The origins of the first amendment</h2>
      <p>The first amendment was written in 1789 and ratified into law in 1791, proposed by James Madison. It was made to prevent a national religion, allow criticizing the government, and have more open debates. The framers didn't highlight the basic freedoms in the Constitution, thinking it was unnecessary.</p>

      <h2 id='case'>De Jonge v. State of Oregon</h2>
      <p>Dirk De Jonge held a meeting in Portland, Oregon that was sponsored by a Community party. The police raided his meeting and arrested him for violating Oregon's anti-Communist laws.</p>
      <p>De Jonge then brought the issue to the Supreme Court, stating that Oregon's criminal syndicalism law, which prevented Communists from having an effect on the labour force, violated due process clause in the 14th amendment. Although the 1st amendment only restricts the federal government from intruding, De Jonge won.</p>
      <h2 id='fite'>Controversies over the freedom of assembly</h2>
      <p>Not everyone is certain if camping in a park after closing hours is protected by the freedom of assembly, which was demonstrated in Occupy Wall Street, where protesters camped at Zuccotti Park for a month.</p>

      <p>The Freedom of Assembly lets students congregate with their friends without having to worry about being punished. If there is anything shady with the government, this freedom allows people to discuss how to improve it.</p>
