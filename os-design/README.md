# idea

(was too lazy to finish, oh well)

basically chromeos since web is cool

URL *always* shows so you know if it's a scam or not

tabs (like Windows Sets) are a good idea for OS

minimalist UI elsewhere; floating toolbar that can be summoned by pressing fn key (basically like windows or chrome search key) if hide by default option is turned on with time, minimized windows, and menu > buttons to sign out etc (can be dragged onto toolbar like on windows)

files app is basically just going to file://some-directory/ and opening a file would require you to install an extension that can open a file type (otherwise big oof)

new tab page could bring up all websites that work offline
