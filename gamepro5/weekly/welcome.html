<p>Minecraft16 is Bryce; I might use both names for the same person so watch out.</p>
<p>I'm Sean, but my POV (and tense) (and thinking processes) isn't very stable.</p>
<h2>Welcome to <cite>The Weekly News</cite>!</h2>
<dd>Note that Bryce did not write this article, Sean did.</dd>
<p>So this is a place where you can obtain knowledge that you might not already know.</p>
<p>You might be wondering why this even started existing.</p>
<p>As you can see I'm not very good at writing long stuff. Things tend to get out of order.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Minecraft16 hands out <a href="?n=2">The Weekly News #2</a> after lunch before this time at school that the school calls "Wednesday Instructional Period" which is a period that is usually (but not always) on Wednesdays in which we are unproductively pretending to do our homework that is often abbrev. as <abbr title="Wednesday Instructional Period">WIP</abbr>.</li>
  <li>Sean gets out his red pen and "corrects" the paper's very horrifying grammar.</li>
  <li>After school ends and people run out of school screaming (majestically not killing anyone sadly), Sean offers to put the newspaper on the web.</li>
  <li>Minecraft16 asks for the game I'm supposed to make to be made. So he can advertise stuff. Advertisements are cool as long as they aren't colorful.</li>
  <li>As you can see, I ended up never making the game. Hopefully he won't notice.</li>
